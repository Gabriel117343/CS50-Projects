sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: this is less efective to sort big random numbers than others, like merge sort or selecting sort, for example in the sort one
it took around 0.505s to sort random10000.txt. Besides i Known that this algorithm is more Effective to Sort Big ammount of numbers (already sorted) than selection Sort but
selection sort but no when the are random numbers, but merge sort it's much faster in that case.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: I noticed that this algorithm of sort is faster than sort1, just taking 0.038s to sort random10000.txt and fasted than sort3.
That's why I conclued that this is the algorithm merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: this algorithm of sort is too similar to sort1 with random10000.txt, but when I increased the ammout of numbers to 50.000 numbers
this took double ammount of thime than using buble sort(sort1). I concluded that this is selection sort.
